Description: This R package provides functions, data, and tutorials to detect genetic pathways enriched with alternatively spliced genes. This analysis takes two paired RNA-seq samples and pathway annotations as inputs. And provides a ranked list of pathways enriched with alternatively spliced genes, along with effect sizes and uncertainty quantification.
